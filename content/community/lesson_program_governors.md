Lesson Program Governors are members of Lesson Program Governance Committees (LPGCs), groups of community members that oversee and guide the strategy and health of The Carpentries Lesson Programs. The responsibilities of Lesson Program Governance Committees fall into three main categories of leadership: strategy, advocacy, and communication. They oversee project strategy, advocate for the lesson program and its community, and communicate with the governance of The Carpentries, the Core Team, and the Carpentries community as a whole.

A Lesson Program Governance Committee will typically have 3-5 members, including at least one member acting in each of the two Officer roles of Chair and Secretary.

Lesson Program Governors are listed on the respective lesson program pages:
