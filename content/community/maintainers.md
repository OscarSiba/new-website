Maintainers are responsible for the day-to-day upkeep of our lessons - making sure they stay accurate, up-to-date, functional, and cohesive.

This page lists our current Maintainers. Previous Maintainers are listed on our [Maintainer Alumni](/community/maintainer-alumni) page. You can learn more about the Maintainer role, and how to become a Maintainer in our Maintainer Handbook.
