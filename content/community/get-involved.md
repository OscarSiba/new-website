## Volunteer Opportunities

The original design for this page had each role listed (Instructor, Trainer, CarpentryCon Committee Member, etc.) with a list of responsibilities, time commitment, steps to get involved, etc.

We are keeping all such content in the Handbook.  Should we still have a page like this? What should go on it?
