title: Our Instructor Trainers
---

The Instructor Trainer community is a group of experienced Instructors, local champions, and education specialists who inspire and prepare new Instructors. They work as a team to maintain and teach the [Instructor Training curriculum]({{< param instructor_training_curriculum >}}). They also host teaching demonstration sessions to provide vital feedback as prospective Carpentries Instructors prepare to join the community. They showcase and embody the enthusiasm and conduct of our community as they prepare new Instructors. Trainers scale their impact - sharing their passion, experience, and enthusiasm with the next generation of The Carpentries Instructors.
