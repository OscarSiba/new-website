## How to list Curriculum Advisors?

Currently, Curriculum Advisors are all listed on [The Carpentries site]( https://carpentries.org/curriculum-advisors/).  They are listed in a simple table, not with profiles like we do for other listings.

Should these be listed in the individual lesson program sites? Library Carpentry lists [Curriculum Advisors on their own page](https://librarycarpentry.org/governance/) (and it does not exactly match the listing on The Carpentries site.)
