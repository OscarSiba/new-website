We would like to share an exciting new collaboration between The Carpentries and the [Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI)](https://datascience.nih.gov/data-ecosystem/generalist-repository-ecosystem-initiative). This collaboration represents a shared commitment to equipping researchers worldwide with the skills and tools needed for effective data and software management, especially within the biomedical research community.
GREI was launched in 2022 by the National Institutes of Health’s [Office of Data Science Strategy](https://datascience.nih.gov/) (NIH ODSS) in the USA to foster robust data-sharing practices, recognising the critical need for researchers to make their data accessible, reusable, and impactful across disciplines. At its core, GREI supports a network of repositories designed to accommodate diverse data types, emphasising usability, discoverability, and adherence to the [FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)](https://force11.org/info/the-fair-data-principles/) principles. This initiative not only provides researchers with the infrastructure to share their data but also offers guidance and tools to improve data management practices, making it easier to comply with data-sharing policies and maximise the reach of their work.
By working together, The Carpentries and GREI aim to align our resources to demystify generalist repositories, enhance workflows for data submission and reuse, and ultimately ensure high-quality, well-documented deposits. But why is this effort so important, and what does it mean for our communities?
## Why Generalist Repositories Matter
Generalist repositories, such as [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu), [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/), [Figshare](https://figshare.com/), [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/), [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/), [Vivli](https://vivli.org/), and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), provide open and accessible spaces for sharing diverse types of research data. Unlike specialised repositories, which are often discipline-specific, generalist repositories are designed to accommodate a wide array of datasets, making research outputs more discoverable and usable by broader audiences. This inclusivity supports interdisciplinary collaboration and accelerates scientific discovery, particularly in biomedical research where diverse datasets can inform critical advancements.
For GREI repositories to reach their full potential, researchers must be equipped with best practices in data management. That’s where The Carpentries and GREI come together. By unifying efforts, we can build skills and create educational resources that support a culture of open science.
## What This Collaboration Looks Like 
Our collaboration explores approaches to integrate best practices into The Carpentries' training programs. Together, we will identify opportunities for alignment with FAIR data principles, enhance existing Carpentries lessons, and create new resources tailored to the needs of the GREI community. This includes:
- __Workshops and Webinars:__ Hosting targeted training sessions to test and refine GREI-informed content.
- __Curriculum Development:__ Evaluating and updating Carpentries lessons to reflect best practices in data sharing and repository use.
- __Community Engagement:__ Leveraging feedback loops through community sessions, online discussions, and more to ensure the materials evolve with the needs of researchers.
## Why This Matters to You
This partnership is more than a shared project; it is an opportunity to bring our communities closer together. For members of The Carpentries community, this collaboration introduces a pathway to engage with generalist repositories and deepen your expertise in open science practices. For GREI stakeholders, the partnership provides a robust framework to drive adoption of best practices.
## What Is Next?
The collaboration is already underway, with plans to hold workshops, review training resources, and foster ongoing discussions across our communities. Together, we are advancing a more inclusive and impactful open science ecosystem.
