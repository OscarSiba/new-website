    - quote: I'm pretty sure I wouldn’t be a gainfully employed climate scientist without The Carpentries. Along the winding academic journey from PhD to postdoc to precarious short-term contracts to finally landing a permanent research position, my involvement with The Carpentries and the skills I've gained from being part of the community has been my point of difference.
